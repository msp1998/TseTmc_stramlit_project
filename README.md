# TseTmc_stramlit_project
This is my first try for creating streamlit apps for Iranian stock market
You can just see depth of stocks from diffrent sector or 6 diffrent stocks.
I have to work on other options.

For run this project, first you have to install all pacakeges inside the code.
For example you have to install stramlit for sure.Open your cmd and type : pip install stramlit 
(If you are in iran I recomend you to use VPN for installing.)
Then open cmd in that path and write this text: stramlit run "first_stramlit.py"
