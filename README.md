# TseTmc_stramlit_project
This is my first try for creating streamlit apps for Iranian stock market
You can just see depth of stocks from diffrent sector or 6 diffrent stocks.
I have to work on other options.

For run this project, first you have to install all pacakeges inside the code.
Then open cmd in that path and write this text: stramlit run "first_stramlit.py"
